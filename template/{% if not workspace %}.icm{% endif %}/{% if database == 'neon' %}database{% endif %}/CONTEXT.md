# Database — the Neon base, a preview branch for a migration, and the migration at build

This build answered `neon` to `database` in `copier.yml`. This file is the database rule for
every environment. `.copier-answers.yml` names `migrations_path`, the folder of the migration
files. Below, `<migrations_path>` is that folder.

## Inputs

| Shape | Neon projects | The base | Reads the base | Integration | Migrates at build, by `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV` | Production migrates |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| With UAT | one for production, one for UAT | the UAT project's default branch | Vercel Preview and `uat` | Production only, or none | `uat` | in `promote.yml`, on `promote.sh run` |
| Without UAT | one | its default branch, production's database | Vercel Preview | Production only, or none | Production, `production` | at the build of `main` |

- **No variable names a project.** The scripts find the base's Neon project by its name,
  `uat-<slug>` with UAT and `<slug>` without, from `slug` in `.copier-answers.yml`. The preview
  branches are cut from it. With UAT, no script reaches the production project. `promote.yml`
  reaches it through the secret `DATABASE_URL` only.
- The build's Vercel projects are the projects in `VERCEL_TEAM` whose git link is this
  repository. `preview-db.sh` acts on each one that has `uat` with UAT, on each one without.
- A preview without a migration reads and writes the base's rows. A tester knows it (why: a
  preview that changes no schema needs no copy · Jamie, 2026-10-27).
- The Neon integration never serves Preview. It makes a branch for every pull request. The
  branch rule below makes one only for a migration.

## Process

**The branch rule.** A pull request whose diff touches `<migrations_path>/**` gets the Neon
branch `preview/<git branch>`. `preview-db.yml` cuts it from the base, with the base's data.
The branch has its own `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` and `MIGRATE_AT_BUILD=1`, on
the Vercel Preview environment, scoped to the git branch. The pull request closes, and
`neon-cleanup.yml` deletes the branch and the three variables. Nothing else deletes a branch
(why: a migration must not change the base before the merge · Jamie, 2026-10-27).

**The migration rule.** `package.json` names `db:migrate` and `db:verify`. Its `vercel-build`
line calls the blueprint's script, and the line never changes (why: the rule lives in a file
that `copier update` changes, so a new tag reaches every build · Jamie, 2026-10-28):

```json
"vercel-build": "bash .icm/scripts/vercel-build.sh next build"
```

- `.icm/scripts/vercel-build.sh` runs `db:migrate`, then `db:verify`, then the build command,
  when one of two conditions is true. Otherwise it only builds. A package below the root
  calls `../.icm/scripts/vercel-build.sh`.
- `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV` names the long-lived environment that owns its database: `uat` with UAT,
  `production` without UAT. Vercel sets it at build, so no person sets it. In a pull request
  preview its value is `preview`.
- `MIGRATE_AT_BUILD=1` marks a preview that owns its own Neon branch. Only `preview-db.sh` sets
  it. A plain preview never carries it (why: a preview without its own branch must not migrate
  the base. The first build of a pull request can run before its branch exists · 2026-10-27).
- With UAT, production never migrates at build, because `promote.yml` migrates production.
  Without UAT, the build of `main` migrates production, then serves it.
- The script gives `db:migrate` and `db:verify` `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` as `DATABASE_URL` when
  it has a value: a migration needs a direct connection.
- A migration at build runs while the previous deployment still serves. So a migration must be
  forward-compatible with the code it replaces.

**The script.** `.icm/scripts/preview-db.sh <verb> <git branch>`. `create`, `delete` and
`status`. `create` redeploys the branch's newest preview only when it changed something. The
two workflows run it. A session runs `status` to read a branch, and `create` or `delete` only
to repair a run that failed.

## Outputs

- `preview/<git branch>` in the base's project, while the pull request is open, and its three
  variables on Vercel Preview of each project, scoped to the git branch.
- A migrated database for each deployment whose `vercel-build` condition is true.

## Setup, once

Jamie does these by hand, before the first pull request with a migration.

1. Neon: with UAT, two projects. Name UAT's `uat-<slug>`. Without UAT, one project, `<slug>`.
2. Vercel → Storage: the Neon integration connected to Production only, with preview branching
   off. Or not connected: then set Production's `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` by hand.
3. Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables: `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` from
   the base on Preview, and with UAT on `uat` too. Never `MIGRATE_AT_BUILD` on Preview for all
   branches. Keep "Enable access to System Environment Variables" on for `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV`.
4. GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions: secrets `NEON_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_TOKEN`, variable `VERCEL_TEAM`.
5. `package.json`: `db:migrate`, `db:verify`, and the `vercel-build` line above.

| Name | Holds | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | the pooled connection string of the environment's database | Vercel |
| `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` | the direct connection string of the same database | Vercel |
| `MIGRATE_AT_BUILD` | `1` on a preview that owns its own Neon branch. Set by `preview-db.sh` only | Vercel Preview, scoped to the git branch |
| `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV` | the deployment's environment, set by Vercel at build and at runtime | Vercel, a system variable |
| `NEON_API_KEY` | a Neon API key for the organisation | Actions secret · the shell |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_TEAM` | as in `.env.example` | Actions · the shell |
